## beepr beeps

Use the function `beep()` in the beepr package to make an audio alert when your code is done running

```{r, eval = FALSE}
for (i in rev(seq(1:99))){
  print(paste(i, "bottles of beer on the wall"))
}

# beep(4)
```

##  praise and cowsay

Packages built with a single purpose: to be kind and fun

Will maintain the capitalization from the input

```{r}
praise("${Exclamation}, ${EXCLAMATION}...${exclamation}!!!")

praise("Holy ${creating}, Batman - this code is ${ADJECTIVE}!")
```

Use cowsay::say() to make a character say something to you

```{r}

```
